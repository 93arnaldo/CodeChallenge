# Umba Code Challenge for Product & Analyst Intern

This project contains the **Code Challenge for Product & Analyst Intern at Umba**. It is divided in **3 main folders**:
- "Joining Tables" 
- "Aggregation" 
- "Data Analysis" 

In the first two folders, you can find a .txt file for each SQL query. In the last folder, "Data Analysis", you can find a Python Jupyter Notebook with the analysis and findings.

Before starting with the queries, I created a short **ER Diagram** that will serve as a tool to understand how the data is related. Please see the image below:
